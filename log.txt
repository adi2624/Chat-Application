issue 1: break not present in the function which checks for current user. Resulted in wrong ID numbers being sent and repeated threads for the same members.
issue 2: OnCreate does not run in order, because firebase OnDataChange in ValueEventListener is asynchronous, put the line needing id inside OnDataChange.
issue 3: If there are not threads present before, 2 threads are launched.
issue 4: In reference to issue 3, if both activities are started and no messages have been sent on either of them, no threads are created, hence 2 different threads are created initially.
